# Vasuki
The name of this programming language comes from Hindu mythology, where Vasuki is the name of a serpent king who is often depicted as a powerful and wise figure. The programming language is named after him to symbolize strength, flexibility, or the ability to handle complex tasks. 
A compiler for a custom language made by me and my friends.
